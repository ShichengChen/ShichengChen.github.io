# PUBLICATION
- Direct, Near Real Time Animation of a 3D Tongue Model Using Non-Invasive
Ultrasound Images
    - **Shicheng Chen**, Yifeng Zheng, Chengrui Wu, Guorui Sheng, Pierre Roussel, Bruce Denby
    
    - Presentation in a **lecture** session at the ICASSP 2018
    - Implement Snake algorithm to extract the sagittal contour from ultrasound images and Select five points from the contour
    - Use these five points to move a 3D tongue model
    - Extract contour or some other information from the model
    - Use the information from the 3D tongue model to tune the snake algorithm
    
- Predicting Tongue Motion in Unlabeled Ultrasound Video Using 3D Convolutional Neural Networks
    - Chengrui Wu, **Shicheng Chen**, Guorui Sheng, Pierre Roussel, Bruce Denby
    
    - Presentation in a **poster** session at the ICASSP 2018.
    - Use the convolutional neural network for several continuous frames to
predict an upcoming tongue image. Make use of both spatial and spatial information.
    - Implement the convolutional neural network to extract the contour from the ultrasound images (semantic segmentation) only by Python and Numpy instead of Deep Learning Libraries.
    - Implement the vectorized convolution layer, deconvolution layer, max
pooling, up pooling, average pooling, batch normalization, RELU.
    - **Challenge**: full vectorized implementation for convolution, pooling, batch
normalization layer.

# PROJECT
- Audio Source Separation
    - Obtain accompaniment and vocals from mix music.
    - Use residual neural network as an encoder to raw audio.
    - Use modified WaveNet as a decoder.
    - The encoding is used to condition a WaveNet decoder.
