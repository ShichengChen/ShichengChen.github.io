# PROJECTS
- Apache SINGA, an open-source deep-learning library
    - Make Singa support ONNX (which is an open format to represent deep learning models backed by Facebook AWS and Microsoft)
    - merged pull request(https://github.com/apache/incubator-singa/pull/444)

- GPU memory management
    - Achieve Singa 20-30% GPU memory usage save with only 2-5% extra computation time for popular networks such as ResNet, UNet, and VGG
    - To the best of our knowledge, we are the first one to try to save memory usage with very little extra computation time.
    
- Audio Source Separation
    - Obtain accompaniment and vocals from mix music.
    - More detail on https://github.com/ShichengChen/Audio-Source-Separation
   
- Multiview Hand Dataset
    - Obtain hand joints by semi-supervised learning
    - Our dataset provides depth, color images, and camera parameters.
