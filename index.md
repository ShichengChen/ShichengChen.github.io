# PROJECTS
- Apache SINGA, an open-source deep-learning library
    - Make Singa support ONNX, an open format to represent deep learning models backed by Facebook, AWS, and Microsoft ([merged pull request](https://github.com/apache/incubator-singa/pull/444))

- GPU memory management
    - Achieve Singa 20-30% GPU memory usage save with only 2-5% extra computation time for popular networks such as ResNet, UNet, and VGG
    
- [Audio Source Separation](https://github.com/ShichengChen/Audio-Source-Separation)
    - Obtain accompaniment and vocals from mixed music.
   
- Multiview Hand Dataset
    - Annotate the hand pose for the hand dataset by semi-supervised learning.
    - Provide hand 3D models, depth images, color images, and camera parameters.
