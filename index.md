# PROJECTS
- Singa, incubated in Apache Foundation, an open-source deep-learning library
    - Make Singa support ONNX (which is an open format to represent deep learning models backed by Facebook AWS and Microsoft)
    - merged pull request(https://github.com/apache/incubator-singa/pull/444)

- GPU memory management
    - Achieve Singa %20-30 GPU memory usage save with only 2-5% extra computation time for popular networks such as ResNet, UNet, and VGG
    - To the best of our knowledge, we are the first one to try to save memory usage with very little extra computation time.
    
- Audio Source Separation
    - Obtain accompaniment and vocals from mix music.
