We developed Apache SINGA, an open-source deep-learning library, and made Singa support ONNX, an open format representing deep learning models backed by Microsoft, Facebook, and AWS.

We optimized the GPU memory management system for Singa. We achieved Singa 20-30% GPU memory usage save with only 2-5% extra computation time for popular networks such as ResNet, UNet, and VGG.

We obtained accompaniment and vocals from mixed music for the audio source separation project.

We made our multiview hand dataset. We annotated the hand pose for the hand dataset by semi-supervised learning. Our dataset provides hand 3D models, depth images, color images, and camera parameters.


We made a publication Bus Travel Speed Prediction using Attention Network of Heterogeneous Correlation Features in 2019 presentation at the SIAM International Conference on Data Mining.
